## Coding Standards

### Python Code Style
- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all public functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and reasonably sized
- Use type hints where appropriate

### Home Assistant Specific
- Follow [Home Assistant development guidelines](https://developers.home-assistant.io/)
- Use Home Assistant's logging system
- Implement proper error handling
- Follow integration best practices

### Frontend Code
- Use modern JavaScript/ES6+
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Comment complex logic
- Ensure responsive design

### Example Code Style
```python
"""Example of proper code style."""
import logging
from typing import Any, Dict, Optional

from homeassistant.core import HomeAssistant
from homeassistant.helpers.typing import ConfigType

_LOGGER = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class AIAgent:
    """AI Agent for processing natural language requests."""
    
    def __init__(self, hass: HomeAssistant, config: ConfigType) -> None:
        """Initialize the AI agent."""
        self.hass = hass
        self.config = config
    
    async def process_request(self, prompt: str) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
        """Process a natural language request.
        
        Args:
            prompt: The user's natural language request
            
        Returns:
            Dict containing the response or None if error
        """
        try:
            # Implementation here
            return {"response": "success"}
        except Exception as err:
            _LOGGER.error("Error processing request: %s", err)
            return None
```

## Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_agent.py

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=custom_components.ai_agent_ha
```

### Writing Tests
- Write tests for new functionality
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Mock external dependencies (AI APIs, Home Assistant)

### Test Structure
```python
"""Test example."""
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch

from custom_components.ai_agent_ha.agent import AIAgent

@pytest.fixture
def mock_hass():
    """Mock Home Assistant instance."""
    return Mock()

async def test_process_request_success(mock_hass):
    """Test successful request processing."""
    agent = AIAgent(mock_hass, {})
    result = await agent.process_request("turn on lights")
    assert result is not None
    assert "response" in result
```
